A voxelizer created in python using GLTFlib package.
Works only with glb files.
Color selection for voxel is very simple. As a result 
of which it might not be best for you.

## Update
The voxelizer now has a function to convert blocks to minecraft blocks and save them as a .schematic file

Block Data is taken from the repo: `https://github.com/LucasDower/ObjToSchematic/tree/main`
Took inspiration from (Lucas Dower)[https://github.com/LucasDower] for the project.

## Problems
* It is not optimal in any way.
* Voxelization algo is very slow.
* Color of voxels is off by a great margin.
* Recent block data for minecraft block not available.
* No oops used.
